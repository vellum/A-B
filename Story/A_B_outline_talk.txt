 About Me & How A/B came about 

[ portrait ] 
- I'm a designer and software developer

[ courier, paper, video ]
- In recent years, I've worked on products like Courier and Paper

[ video ]
- Perhaps less recently, I was very much INTO data and data visualization
- When I was a young designer in the early 2000s i apprenticed under Lisa Strausfeld at Pentagram Design in NYC

[ BIG DATA / URBAN DATA ]
[ video, video, video ]
- And as a slightly older designer in the late 2000s i was a research fellow at the Senseable City Lab at MIT, where I made visualizations of urban data, with the hope that visualizations can feed back into the operation of the city

[ sadface ]	 
 the sad reality is that these macro level visualizations frequently have little impact on real people
 
[SMALL DATA]
when i left my full time job at microsoft a year and a half ago, i started to think about ways to make data
